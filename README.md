# Distributed Ticket Vending Machine using Multi-Paxos algorithm
The goal of the project was to implement a distributed system to simulate simultaneous ticket sales for a soccer match at ticket vending machines located at different locations. 
A distributed system was designed using Multi-Paxos algorithm to handle site failures and network partition. The total number of tickets available was known to every client and any change made by ticket sales was reflected on every server.
